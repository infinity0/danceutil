stances:
  closed:
    description: |
      Stances where the primary communication is via inside arms
      i.e. lead right arm, follow left arm. For example:

      - close embrace - torsos connected
        lead arm on follow back
      - semi-closed embrace - facing at an angle, like a half-open book
        default "closed position" for Lindy Hop
      - open embrace - torsos not connected
        lead hand on follow back, rather than entire arm on back
      - inside-side - side-by-side, lead on left
        default "closed position" for Charleston
    default connection: 2H
    valid connections: [1H-I, 2H, 2T-B, 2T-F, 2X-R, 2X-L, 2XB-R, 2XB-L, 2Q-R, 2Q-L, 2QL-R, 2QL-L]

  tandem:
    description: |
      Stances where lead is directly behind/front follow.
      Follow's footwork matches lead's, instead of mirroring.
    default connection: 2T-B
    valid connections: [1X-R, 1X-L, 2T-B, 2T-F, 2Q-R, 2Q-L, 2QL-R, 2QL-L]

  open:
    description: |
      Stances where the primary communication is via outside hands

      - open position
      - outside-side - side-by-side, lead on right
    default connection: 1H-O
    valid connections: [1H-O, 1X-R, 1X-L, 1H-I, 2H, 2T-B, 2T-F, 2X-R, 2X-L, 2XB-R, 2XB-L]
